<h1>Email Request Workflow</h1>
<p class="text-muted">
  Use this guide when sending a booking request from the quote screen. The form creates a
  pre-filled email in your default mail client so operations can review and dispatch the load.
</p>

<h2 id="body-layout">Receipt-style composed body sections</h2>
<p>
  Selecting <strong>Compose Email</strong> builds a plain-text message with fixed sections that keep
  shipment data easy to scan. The generated body mirrors a receipt layout with separators and
  consistent labels.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Quote Details:</strong> Includes the quote ID and whether a return quote is requested.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shipment Specifications:</strong> Lists origin, destination, pieces, weight, weight type,
    and accessorial labels.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pricing Breakdown:</strong> Shows base charge, each accessorial amount, and the final total
    (plus the email admin fee when configured).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Logistics Contacts:</strong> Captures shipper and consignee names, addresses, contacts,
    phone numbers, and optional notes.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shipment-data">Piece count and weight method</h2>
<p>
  The shipment section always includes total pieces and weight in pounds, then prints the saved
  weight method in parentheses:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Actual</code> when the quote is priced using measured weight.</li>
  <li><code>Dimensional</code> when the quote is priced by dimensional weight rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This output comes directly from <code>quote.weight_method</code>, so users do not need to select it
  again on the email form.
</p>

<h2 id="return-quote">Return quote checkbox behavior and intent</h2>
<p>
  The highlighted return shipment section appears near the end of the form, directly above
  <strong>Compose Email</strong>. It includes the return quote checkbox and, when selected,
  additional fields for desired return pickup date, return accessorial selection, and return-specific
  notes.
</p>
<p>
  In the composed message, the app always sets <strong>Return Quote: YES/No</strong> in Quote Details.
  If the box is selected, a dedicated <strong>[ RETURN SHIPMENT REQUEST ]</strong> block is added
  immediately after consignee notes so operations can review return handling requirements in one place.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose is to alert operations that the same customer may need a quote for the reverse lane,
  so the team can follow up with return pricing after the outbound request is reviewed.
</p>

<h2 id="handoff">Mailto handoff to operations inbox</h2>
<p>
  The form does not send mail directly from the web app. Instead, it creates a
  <code>mailto:</code> link that opens your local email client with the subject and body prefilled.
  The recipient is always the operations inbox:
  <a href="mailto:operations@freightservices.net">operations@freightservices.net</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review the message content in your email client before sending.</li>
  <li>Add attachments or internal recipients if your process requires them.</li>
  <li>Send the message to complete the handoff from quoting to operations.</li>
</ul>
